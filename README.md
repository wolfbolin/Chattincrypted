# Chattincrypted
A Java desktop application for end-to-end encrypted chatting in untrusted network.



### How to use?

Download the Java application, and start to enjoy it. 



### How's this idea come from?

There are many apps to chat secretly and conveniently on the mobile phone. On the desktop, we usually use email with PGP encrypted for secret messaging. That's not an elegant way to chat. Hence we come up with an idea of building an encrypted chat desktop application using OpenPGP technology that every privacy-lover fancied.
